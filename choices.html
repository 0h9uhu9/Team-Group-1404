<h1>What are the Choices</h1>

<p>Technology has provided hope and change in which the public health is able to provide the best care for the human race in comparison to the past. For example, vaccines were a success in minimizing the death rate with its infectious diseases. Through the vaccines, only then it was known what type of side effects it would implicate and the health risks. Nanotechnology was used to improve the hepatitis B vaccine in modern medical practice which has influenced the population health (Pautler & Brenner, 2010).  Nanomedicine has the ability to have a substantial effect on the chronic disease battle.</p

<p>Due to nanomedicine applications materializing within the healthcare system, it is advisable that the public health workers would need to know more about the contents of nanotechnology and how this can be incorporated within the health environment through training and education. Health professionals would need to learn about the increasing benefits of nanotechnology and its effect on population health to assist in delivering informative contents of its purpose to researchers and medical professionals. In addition, it can provide better patient care by partnering up with other health sectors in the future. New age scientists will provide a wealth of knowledge on how nanotechnology and medicine can be used by implementing nanomedicine for change (Pautler & Brenner, 2010). </p>
