<h1>Ethical Issues and Reflections</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations [Individual].<p></h4>

<p>With the research that I have done, I found out that there are a lot of number of ways that nanotechnology can develop for the better of humanity. This technology is advancing at a fast rate within different fields of sciences and industry which has a broad of topics we could choose from. However, I decided with my group to focus on the advantages and risks involved of nanotechnology in the field of medicine. Researching about nanotechnology showed me a lot of benefits it can bring it can offer for patients and a huge range of utilities to be used by doctors to cure the patients. 
<br><br>The idea of using nanoparticles to target a certain organ for drug delivery was intriguing for me. Finding out that nanoparticles could be used to boost our immune responses for vaccinations and efficacy of drugs would prove to be helpful in saving the lives of many people. Diagnostics without going to the clinic or hospital would be helpful for elderly people who might not have the strength to visit a doctor and especially during times such as a pandemic, where going out is limited. However, with advantages it does bring disadvantages as well. The built up of nanoparticles causing other disease, for me it contradicts its purpose of boosting the immune responses, as research did state that the build up of these nanoparticles in our bones and other organs could possibly lead to a decline of responsiveness in our immune systems. Hence, this could cause greater problems in the future and might lead the patient being weakened or worse the demise of the patient itself. 
<br><br>One recommendation I would possibly give to counter such scenarios could be to have a limited number of use of nanoparticles. Doctors should not always rely on nanoparticles as the first medical method of curing patients. Instead, it should be a second option when patient conditions get worse. This would mean that the patient is less likely to be intoxicated by the built up of the nanoparticles and not lead the patient to a greater risk of other infections and diseases that might try to invade their body.</p>

<p>Before individually researching the topic of nanotechnology and nanomedicine, my initial assumptions were that it was a highly specialized field of science that only had specific technical uses in multi-billion dollar industries such as Aerospace research and electronics industry. This was largely due to the fact that the word 'nanotechnology' carried connotations of being a futuristic area of science, thus I assumed that it was just a hypothetical conceptual science that was not actually being actively incorporated as a working science in many different industry sectors. Through my research I learnt that nanotechnology is being continuously research in the medical industry, and I was surprised to find out that there was already a completed development into nanoparticles that are engineered to deliver specific substances to specific biological cells in a living organisms body, which would allow direct interaction with malignant cells that show signs of developing into cancer cells. I didn't know beforehand that rapid technological advancements in the nanotechnology field were already happening in the global science indurstry, and its applications were that extensive to so many different industries that you would not initially think would benefit from nanotechnology products.</p>
<p>The main ethical issue that I think needs to be seriously addressed in the future in the nanomedicine science field is the scientific breakthrough of genetic modifications made possible through specifically engineered nanotechnology devices. The ethical issue in this technological advancement is that this would allow humans direct modification of human DNA, and thus allow humanity to "play the role of god" for the first time in human history. A technology like this would become too powerful in that it would have virtually unlimited applications and would have a sizeable impact on nearly every industry globally, due to the fact that it is a science that directly modifies the fundamental traits of all life on Earth, not just humans. There is too much potential in this specific branch of genetic modifications in the nanotechnology field that if it does become a reality, there would need to be a serious consideration of international laws created just for the nanotechnology science field to limit its development for nefarious uses, which is just as numerous as its potentially positive uses.</p>

<p>Health information of patients comes with great importance as it raises an ethical concern in relation to nanomedicine. Nanotechnology has the ability to store a large quantity of data which it records the results of body organs, tissues or individual cells which can then be transferred electronically in todays society (Bawa & Johnson, 2007, as cited in Andorno & Biller-Andorno, 2014).  In addition, it would become a mission and quite complex to store personal information and at the same time protect personal data which can be shared through technology. This will only enhance the clinicianâ€™s awareness to have a fail-safe system put into practice to protect health data that would exclude the use of nanotechnology devices. A disease can be identified through the use of molecular imaging if it is detected early such as cancer. This allows for the image to be manipulated by increasing the resolution to get a clearer view of where the markers lay which provides a diagnosis.  Furthermore, it is beneficial for future clinical applications in therapy which will be more affordable. (Riehemann et al., 2009).</p>

<p>During this project it has given me the opportunity to do some research on what some of the risks could be in nanotechnology in medicine. I've never heard of Nanotechnology and was a bit intimidated by the name once we chose this as our group topic, however, I was determined to explore what the world of nanotechnology had to teach me.
I found that an ethical issue in nanomedicine is protecting patients private information where medical records of body organs are stored electronically of the patients results. In addition, it has been revealed that when clinicians have a consultation remotely with their patients to discuss test results or diagnosis that has recently been discovered, this data is already stored in the system which is allocated against the patients file. The quantity of the storage is quite large, therefore it is recommended to have a highly sourced secure system to protect patient information from a cyber-attack. Nanoparticles can be a risk when it enters the body as this could attack an important body organ which is the brain through a new drug. If the new drug passed through the blood brain barrier which protects toxins trying to enter the brain, this will affect the spinal cord or lead to another condition. The thought that nanoparticles can enter the body through using sunscreen is something to be wary of.
